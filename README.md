# Quickstarts for Friends
Quick start guides for my friends.

## Mobile
For doing mobile you want to consider a few things:

* _iOS_ is where the majority of money is made currently
* You can only test/publish _iOS_ apps using a Mac, so you will need access to one, but can do most of your dev on a _Windows_/_Linux_ box using _Android_ if you use one of the cross platform solutions.
* There are registration fees per app store to publish your apps.
* _Android_ has multiple app stores.

### NativeScript
_NativeScript_ is a _Telerik_ product that allows you to develop mobile apps for _iOS_ and _Android_ using angular 2 semantics that translate to native controls and performance across the platforms.

You can find my **quickstart** guide at [./nativescript](https://github.com/G3N7/quickstart/tree/master/nativescript)

Modern _MEAN_ stack: _MongoDB_, _express_, _Angular2+_, _Node.js_
